# Module 07-Unit 5 Restrict network access to PaaS resources with virtual network service endpoints

## Lab Overview 
In this lab, you will learn how to restrict network access to Azure PaaS resources using virtual network service endpoints. Service endpoints allow you to secure access to Azure services like Azure Storage, making sure that traffic to these services stays within your private network and does not go over the public internet. You will configure network security groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic, and you’ll test connectivity by deploying virtual machines (VMs) and verifying access to the resources.

## Lab Objectives
  
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a virtual network
+ Task 2: Enable a service endpoint
+ Task 3: Restrict network access for a subnet
+ Task 4: Add additional outbound rules 
+ Task 5: Allow access for RDP connections
+ Task 6: Restrict network access to a resource
+ Task 7: Create a file share in the storage account
+ Task 8: Restrict network access to a subnet
+ Task 9: Create virtual machines
+ Task 10: Confirm access to storage account
+ Task 11: Confirm access is denied to storage account

## Estimated time: 35 minutes

1. Close the remote desktop session to the ContosoPrivate VM.

## Task 11: Confirm access is denied to storage account

In this task, you'll confirm that the ContosoPublic VM doesn't have access to the storage account because it's deployed in the Public subnet, which doesn't have the required service endpoint enabled.

1. Navigate to the **Azure portal**, and select the **Virtal machines**.

1. Select **ContosoPublic** Virtal machine.

1. Complete steps 1-13 of previous task to get Confirm access to storage account task for the ContosoPublic VM.  
     
1. ‎After a short wait, you receive a New-PSDrive : Access is denied error. Access is denied because the ContosoPublic VM is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet, not the Public subnet.

1. Confirm that the public VM does have outbound connectivity to the internet from a command prompt:

   **ping bing.com**

1. Close the remote desktop session to the ContosoPublic VM.

1. From your computer, browse to the Azure portal.

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Storage Account (1)**, and then select **Storage Account (2)** under services.

1. Select **contosostorage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. From left navigation pane of storage account under **Data storage**, select **File shares (1)** and select the **marketing (2)** file share.

   **Note**:  Access is denied, because your computer is not in the Private subnet of the CoreServicesVNet virtual network.

   **Warning**: Prior to continuing you should remove all resources used for this lab. To do this On the Azure portal select Resource groups. Select any resources groups you have created. On the resource group blade select Delete Resource group, enter the Resource Group Name and select Delete. Repeat the process for any additional Resource Groups you may have created. Failure to do this may cause issues with other labs.

## Key takeaways
+ Virtual network service endpoints extend your private address space in Azure by providing a direct connection to your Azure services.
+ Service endpoints let you secure your Azure resources to only your virtual network. Service traffic will remain on the Azure backbone, and doesn't go out to the internet.
+ Azure service endpoints are available for many services, such as: Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, and Azure Cosmos DB.
+ Virtual network service endpoints are not, by default, accessible from on-premises networks. To access resources from an on-premises network, use NAT IPs.

## Review
In this lab, you have completed:

+ Create a virtual network
+ Enable a service endpoint
+ Restrict network access for a subnet
+ Add additional outbound rules 
+ Allow access for RDP connections
+ Restrict network access to a resource
+ Create a file share in the storage account
+ Restrict network access to a subnet
+ Create virtual machines
+ Confirm access to storage account
+ Confirm access is denied to storage account

## You have successfully completed the lab.
