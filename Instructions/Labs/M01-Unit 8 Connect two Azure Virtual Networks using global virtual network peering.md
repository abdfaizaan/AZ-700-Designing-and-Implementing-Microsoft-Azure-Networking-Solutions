#  Lab 1c: Connect two Azure Virtual Networks using global virtual network peering

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to configure connectivity between two Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) by using VNet Peering. Specifically, the lab will focus on connecting CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet to allow seamless traffic flow between them. This capability enables communication between resources in different VNets without requiring a VPN gateway or public IP addresses, and it also ensures high availability and scalability for network resources.

## Lab Objective

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine to test the configuration
+ Task 2: Connect to the Test VMs using RDP
+ Task 3: Test the connection between the VMs
+ Task 4: Create VNet peerings between CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet
+ Task 5: Test the connection between the VMs
+ Task 6: Clean up resources

## Estimated time: 20 minutes

### Task 1: Create a Virtual Machine to test the configuration

In this task, you will create a test VM on the Manufacturing VNet to test if you can access resources inside another Azure virtual network from your ManufacturingVnet.

#### Create ManufacturingVM

1. On the Azure portal select the **Cloud shell** (**[>_]**)  button at the top of the page to the right of the search box. This opens a cloud shell pane at the bottom of the portal.

## Task 5: Test the connection between the VMs

In this task, you'll be testing the connectivity between the ManufacturingVM and TestVM1 after setting up the VNet peering between CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet. 

1. On the **ManufacturingVM,** open a PowerShell prompt.

1. Use the following command to verify that there is now a connection to TestVM1 on CoreServicesVnet. 

   ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389
    ```

1. The test connection should succeed, and you will see a result similar to the following:

   ![Powershell window with Test-NetConnection 10.20.20.4 -port 3389 showing TCP test succeeded: true](../media/azn29.png)

## Task 6: Clean up resources

In this task, you'll be cleaning up the Azure resources you've created during this module to avoid unnecessary charges.
  
   >**Note**: Remember to remove any newly created Azure resources that you no longer use. Removing unused resources ensures you will not see unexpected charges.

1. On the Azure portal, open the **PowerShell** session within the **Cloud Shell** pane. (Create Cloud Shell storage if needed, using default settings.)

1. Delete all resource groups you created throughout the labs of this module by running the following command:

   ```powershell
   Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name 'ContosoResourceGroup-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>' -Force -AsJob
   ```

    >**Note**: The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.


## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 

+ Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two Azure virtual networks. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes.
+ Azure supports connecting virtual networks within the same Azure region and across Azure regions (global).
+ The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks is routed directly through the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, not through a gateway or over the public Internet.
+ You can resize the address space of Azure virtual networks that are peered without incurring any downtime on the currently peered address space.

## Review

In this lab, you have completed:

+ Creating a Virtual Machine to test the configuration
+ Connecting to the Test VMs using RDP
+ Testing the connection between the VMs
+ Creating VNet peerings between CoreServicesVnet and ManufacturingVnet
+ Testing the connection between the VMs

## You have successfully completed the lab.
