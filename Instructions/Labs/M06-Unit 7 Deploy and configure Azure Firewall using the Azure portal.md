# Module 06-Unit 7 Deploy and configure Azure Firewall using the Azure portal

## Lab scenario 

Being part of the Network Security team at Contoso, your next task is to create firewall rules to allow/deny access to certain websites. The following steps walk you through creating a resource group, a virtual network and subnets, and a virtual machine as environment preparation tasks, and then deploying a firewall and firewall policy, configuring default routes and application, network and DNAT rules, and finally testing the firewall.

**Note:** An **[interactive lab simulation](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Deploy%20and%20configure%20Azure%20Firewall%20using%20the%20Azure%20portal)** is available that allows you to click through this lab at your own pace. You may find slight differences between the interactive simulation and the hosted lab, but the core concepts and ideas being demonstrated are the same.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a virtual network and subnets
+ Task 2: Create a virtual machine
+ Task 3: Deploy the firewall and firewall policy
+ Task 4: Create a default route
+ Task 5: Configure an application rule
+ Task 6: Configure a network rule
+ Task 7: Configure a Destination NAT (DNAT) rule
+ Task 8: Change the primary and secondary DNS address for the server's network interface
+ Task 9: Test the firewall

## Estimated time: 60 minutes

 ## Task 8: Change the primary and secondary DNS address for the server's network interface

For testing purposes in this exercise, in this task, you will configure the Srv-Work server's primary and secondary DNS addresses. However, this is not a general Azure Firewall requirement.

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Resource groups**, and then select **Resource 
   groups** under services.

     ![](../media/unit80.png)

1. In the list of resource groups, select your resource group, **Test-FW-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

1. In the list of resources in this resource group, select the **Network interface** for the **Srv-Work** virtual machine (e.g., **srv-work-nic**).

      ![](../media/unit81.png)

1. From the left navigation menu, under **Settings**, select **DNS servers**.

1. Under **DNS servers**, select **Custom**.

1. Enter **209.244.0.3** in the **Add DNS server** text box, and **209.244.0.4** in the next text box.

1. Select **Save**.

## Task 9: Test the firewall

In this final task, you will test the firewall to verify that the rules are configured correctly and working as expected. This configuration will enable you to connect a remote desktop connection to the Srv-Work virtual machine through the firewall, via the firewall's public IP address.

1. Within Labvm from start menu, open **Remote Desktop Connection**.

1. On the **Computer** box, enter the firewall's public IP address followed by **:3389** (e.g., **20.90.136.51:3389**) and select **Connect**.

     ![Add a network rule collection](../media/l6u7-12.png)
 
1. On the **Enter your credentials** dialog box, log into the **Srv-Work** server virtual machine, on the **Username** box, enter **TestUser** and Password **Pa55w.rd!!**.

1. Select **OK**.

1. Select **Yes** on the certificate message.

1. Open Internet Explorer and browse to **https://www.google.com**

1. On the **Security Alert** dialog box, select **OK**.

1. Select **Close** on the Internet Explorer security alerts that may pop-up.

1. You should see the Google home page.

     ![RDP session on Srv-work server - browser on google.com](../media/L6U7-2.png)

1. Browse to **https://www.microsoft.com**

1. You should be blocked by the firewall.

## Extend your learning with Copilot

Copilot can assist you in learning how to use the Azure scripting tools. Copilot can also assist in areas not covered in the lab or where you need more information. Open an Edge browser and choose Copilot (top right) or navigate to *copilot.microsoft.com*. Take a few minutes to try these prompts.
+ Provide three common usage scenarios for firewalls. 
+ Provide a table comparing the features of the Azure Firewall SKUs.
+ Describe the three types of rules you can create for an Azure Firewall.

## Learn more with self-paced training

+ [Introduction to Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-azure-firewall/). In this module, you learn how Azure Firewall protects Azure virtual network resources including features, rules, and deployment options.
+ [Introduction to Azure Firewall Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-azure-firewall-manager/). In this module, you learn how Azure Firewall Manager provides central security policy and route management for cloud-based security perimeters.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 
+ A firewall is a network security feature that sits between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the internet. The firewall's job is to analyze and then allow or deny network traffic.
+ Azure Firewall is a cloud-based firewall service. In most configurations, Azure Firewall is provisioned inside a hub virtual network. Traffic to and from the spoke virtual networks and the on-premises network is directed to the firewall.
+ Firewall rules evaulate the network traffic. Azure Firewall has three types of rules: Application, Network, and NAT. 
+ Azure Firewall is offered in three SKUs: Standard, Premium, and Basic.
