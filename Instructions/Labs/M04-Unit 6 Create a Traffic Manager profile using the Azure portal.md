# Lab 4b: Create a Traffic Manager profile using the Azure portal

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will create a Traffic Manager profile to deliver high availability for the fictional Contoso Ltd organization's web application.
You will create two instances of a web application deployed in two different regions (**<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** and West Europe). The **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** region will act as a primary endpoint for Traffic Manager, and the West Europe region will act as a failover endpoint.

You will then create a Traffic Manager profile based on endpoint priority. This profile will direct user traffic to the primary site running the web application. Traffic Manager will continuously monitor the web application, and if the primary site in **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** is unavailable, it will provide automatic failover to the backup site in West Europe.

## Lab Objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create the web apps
+ Task 2: Create a Traffic Manager profile
+ Task 3: Add Traffic Manager endpoints
+ Task 4: Test the Traffic Manager profile

## Estimated time: 35 minutes

## Task 3: Add Traffic Manager endpoints

In this task, you will add the website in the **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>** as the primary endpoint to route all the user traffic. You will then add the website in West Europe as a failover endpoint. If the primary endpoint becomes unavailable, then traffic will automatically be routed to the failover endpoint.

1. On Azure Portal page, in **Search resources, services and docs (G+/)** box at the top of the portal, enter **Traffic Manager profiles (1)**, and then select **Traffic Manager profiles (2)** under services.

    ![Picture 19](../media/azn51.png)

1. Kindly refresh the page to find and select **Contoso-TMProfile<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.

   | **Setting**          | **Value**                         |
   | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
   | Type                 | **Azure endpoint (1)**                |
   | Name                 | **myPrimaryEndpoint (2)**             |
   | Target resource type | **App Service (3)**                   |
   | Target resource      | **ContosoWebAppEastUS<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (**<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false"/>**) (4)** |
   | Priority             | **1 (5)**                             |

   ![Picture 21](../media/azn65.png)

1. Select **+Add**, to create the **failover endpoint**.

1. Use the same settings as before except for the information in the table below and then **Add (6)**.

   | **Setting**     | **Value**                                 |
   | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
   | Type                 | **Azure endpoint (1)**                |   
   | Name            | **myFailoverEndpoint (2)**                    |
   | Target resource type | **App Service (3)**                   |
   | Target resource | **ContosoWebAppWestEurope<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (West Europe) (4)** |
   | Priority        | **2 (5)**                                     |

   ![Picture 21](../media/azn66.png)      
      
    >**Note:** Setting a priority of 2 means that traffic will route to this failover endpoint if the configured primary endpoint becomes unhealthy.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Configuration (1)**, and then update the **Endpoint monitor settings** protocol to **HTTPS (2)** and **Port** to **443 (3)** and select **Save (4)**.

   ![Picture 21](../media/azn-67.png)    

1. The two new endpoints are displayed in the Traffic Manager profile. Notice that after a few minutes the **Monitoring status (1)** should change to **Online (2)**.

## Task 4: Test the Traffic Manager profile

In this task, you will check the DNS name of your Traffic Manager profile, and then you will configure the primary endpoint so that it is unavailable. You will then verify that the web app is still available, to test that the Traffic Manager profile is successfully sending traffic to the failover endpoint.

1. On the **Contoso-TMProfile<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** page, select **Overview**.

1. On the **Overview** screen, copy the **DNS name** entry to the clipboard (or take note of it somewhere).

   ![Picture 21](../media/azn69.png) 

1. Open a web browser tab, and paste (or enter) the **DNS name** entry (contoso-tmprofile.trafficmanager.net) into the address bar, and press Enter.

1. If you encounter **your coneection isn't private**. click on **advanced (1)** and then click on link provide **(2)**.

   ![Picture 24](../media/azn70.png)

1. The web app's default web site should be displayed.

   ![Picture 24](../media/M0406.5.png)

    >**Note**: If you get **404 Web Site not found** message, **Disable profile** from **Contoso-TMProfile<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** Traffic Manager profile overview page.

     ![Picture 24](../media/azn71.png)    
    
     - Then select **Enable profile**. Then refresh the webpage.
   
1. Currently all traffic is being sent to the primary endpoint as you set its **Priority** to **1**.

1. To test the failover endpoint is working properly, you need to disable the primary site.

1. On the **Contoso-TMProfile<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** page, click on **Endpoint (1)** and then select **myPrimaryEndpoint** edit icon **(2)**.

   ![Picture 24](../media/azn72.png)

1. On the **myPrimaryEndpoint** page, under **Enable Endpoint**, select **Disable (1)** the checbox, and then select **Save (2)**.

   ![Picture 25](../media/azn73.png)

1. Close the **myPrimaryEndpoint** page (select the **X** in the top right corner of the page).

1. On the **Contoso-TMProfile<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** page, the **Monitor status** for **myPrimaryEndpoint** should now be **Disabled**.

   ![Picture 25](../media/azn74.png)

1. Open a new web browser session, and paste (or enter) the **DNS name** entry (contoso-tmprofile.trafficmanager.net) into the address bar, and press Enter.

1. Verify that the web app is still responding. As the primary endpoint was not available, the traffic was instead routed to the failover endpoint to allow the web site to still function.

1. The command executes asynchronously (as determined by the -AsJob parameter), so while you will be able to run another PowerShell command immediately afterwards within the same PowerShell session, it 
   will take a few minutes before the resource groups are actually removed.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the main takeaways for this lab. 
+ Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer. This service allows you to distribute traffic to your public facing applications across the global Azure regions.
+ Traffic Manager has six traffic-routing methods that allow you to control how Traffic Manager chooses which endpoint should receive traffic from each end user. How many can you name?
+ You can nest Traffic Manager profiles to combine the benefits of more than one traffic-routing method. Nested profiles allow you to override the default Traffic Manager behavior to support larger and more complex application deployments.

## Review
In this lab, you have completed:
+ Create the web apps
+ Create a Traffic Manager profile
+ Add Traffic Manager endpoints
+ Test the Traffic Manager profile
 
## You have successfully completed the lab.
